## Where is Vincey?

I built an R Shiny app that let people know where I was when I was travelling around Europe in Summer 2017. You can view the app [here](http://whereis.vinceyau.me) and the project documentation [here](/where-is) (incomplete).

### Data 
I used Excel and VLOOKUPs to create a .csv file with the date and location latitude and longitude.
